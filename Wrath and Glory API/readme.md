# WH40k Wrath & Glory (Advanced API) Character Sheet

This is a multi-purpose sheet for both characters (default view) and NPC's based on the quickstart rules (subject to change).  

This Wrath & Glory character sheet provides dice automation for inline dice rolls for any user and is integrated with the Wrath & Glory dice roller API for mentor level gamemasters. 

Please note that the inline dice roll macros do not fully enable the type of dice rolls made in the Wrath & Glory system.  Users will need to hover over the inline roll results to count the number of successes (4 or 5 = 1 success; a 6 = an exalted icon that may be shifted to 2 successes).  At this point it does not add modifiers to the rolls for inline dice.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback (all welcome) please contact Barry at btsnyder@gmail.com

### Current Version
Version 2.0 (August 16th, 2018) 

### Thanks	
Many thanks to my players (Dave, Brian, Charles, Matt, and Tyler) for their patience as I evolved the sheet and die roller (sometimes in the middle of play) over the past several weeks.

### Planned Releases

v3.0. add table rolls with option to send to GM only: 
    - Critical Hit Table (creatures, vehicles, and voidships), complications (257), objectives, scatter results, misc damage (hazards), Dangers of the warp, 
    - This will change the checkbox for NPC to a radio button (PC/Adversary, NPC, Die Rolls)
    - This also provides a future capability to expand and add a tab for vehicles and voidships (assuming the game follows a similar route as the previous WH40k system)
    
v4.0. Redo NPC Layout with an order close to the core rulebook stat block.

v5.0. Automate all calculated fields for performance and speed of character creation.
    - includes automated calculation of traits
    - validate impact on NPC where the same fields are not RO
    - when auto-calculating, need to allow the use of STR for Fel for influence for orks, and intellect in place of Fel for Mechanicus

v6.0. Add modifiers to inline rolls.

v7.0. Create a seperate sheet for Vehicles and Voidships; simplifying the view on the PC sheet.
    - Vehicle/Voidships will have their own attack tables.
