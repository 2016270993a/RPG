# WH40k Wrath & Glory (Advanced API) Character Sheet

This is a multi-purpose sheet for both characters (default view) and NPC's based on the quickstart rules (subject to change).  

This Wrath & Glory character sheet provides dice automation for inline dice rolls for any user and is integrated with the Wrath & Glory dice roller API for mentor level gamemasters. 

Please note that the inline dice roll macros do not fully enable the type of dice rolls made in the Wrath & Glory system.  Users will need to hover over the inline roll results to count the number of successes (4 or 5 = 1 success; a 6 = an exalted icon that may be shifted to 2 successes); the inline rolls do not allow for counting if a 6 is = to 2 successes.  At this point it does not add modifiers to the rolls for inline dice.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback (all welcome) please contact Barry at btsnyder@gmail.com

### Thanks	
Many thanks to my players (Dave, Brian, Charles, Matt, and Tyler) for their patience as I evolved the sheet and die roller (sometimes in the middle of play) over the past several weeks.

Many thanks to the following individuals who reported defects and provided improvements: 
1. Morback: extra die on rolls + implement force to add 1/2 willpower to weapon DR + corruption level and roll changes
2. Dean: update wounds to include wounds_max for token bar linking + notes field for Gear + minor spelling errors


### Planned Releases

v2.0. Automate all calculated fields for performance and speed of character creation. 
    - includes automated calculation of traits
    - validate impact on NPC where the same fields are not RO
    - when auto-calculating, need to allow the use of STR for Fel for influence for orks, and intellect in place of Fel for Mechanicus
	
v3.0. Redo NPC Layout with an order close to the core rulebook stat block. 

v4.0. Refine Inline rolls 
    - Add modifiers to each roll
    - a 6 = two successes


	
### Changelog

** October 14th, 2018: version 2.2 - Enhancements & Fixes** 

Updates:
1. Fixed minor types [Thanks to Dean for the catch]
2. Fixed label on Persuasion roll - when rolled it said Persuasion Assist when it should have been persuasion.
3. Roll Glory now uses API or inline dice rolling.
4. Added hover text to skills for quick reference on use.
5. Removed woundscurrent and shockcurrent and added wounds_max and shock_max so token bars operate properly [Thanks to Dean for the suggestion]
6. Created script to update wounds and shock based on existing scores in woundscurrent and shockcurrent
7. Added a gear tooltip to the gear and assets for PC's [Thanks to Dean for the suggestion]
8. added a quantity field to gear [Thanks to Dean for the suggestion]
9. Auto calculate wounds_max and shock_max; wounds = modified toughness + tier + mod; shock = modified willpower + tier + mod.  Both shock and wounds will also calculate off of custom tier.
10. Added a Mod field to shock and wounds to update values from abilities, powers, etc.
11. Added check on tier; when not set to custom the value is changed to 0.
12. Added Lightly wounded value.
13. Auto Generate light and heavy wounded values.
14. Salvo needs to be a text field to allow for --; -- has specific rules implementations.  Field originally allowed only numeric characters.
15. If a psyker (added as a checkbox under keywords) and a weapon is a force weapon add 1/2 Base Willpower to DR.  If the character is not a psyker and the weapon is a force weapon -2 to DR. [Thanks to Morback for the suggestion]
16. For PC & NPC sheets: Onload of a character sheet with current version, automatically update all weapon DR's, corruption levels, wound, shock, light wounded, heavy wounded.

** September 23rd, 2018: version 2.1 - Fixes** 

Updates:
1. Fixed all attack rolls using the API (character, NPC, Vehicle, Voidship); the feed to the API was not subtracting a die for Wrath from the pool being rolled.
2. Modified Corruption line under mental/social traits to list level of corruption and DN per page 367 of core rulebook.
3. Added Resist Corruption line under mental/social traits after the Corruption Rating
4. Fixed Mission BP not being added to totals.

** August 20th, 2018: version 2.0 - Base Rule Alignment Changes** 

Updates:
1. Changed XP labels to BP and tweaked layout on the progression tab; still same effect.
2. Updated NPC Type list (added Elite and renamed Monster to Monstrous Creature).
3. Added Assets to Gear Label so now it is Gear & Assets.
4. Changed NPC Size to a drop down populated with the size categories.
5. Updated Tier to a dropdown and added a note section for ascension notes.
6. Removed Rank Bonus (redundant) and added the rank description as a drop down.
7. Added a custom field for Tier; the rules talk about GM's having tiers higher than 5.
8. Removed dice rolling for Passive Awareness and Wealth; neither have dice rolls per core rules.
9. Added Passive Awareness and Conviction to NPC's.
10. Added empty checkbox to weapons on both PC and NPC tables to track when you use your last reload and you have not emptied the weapon yet.  On the next complication or other event the weapon is out of ammo.
11. Added a seventh tab and reorganized content - Abilities, talents, and psychic power are on the 'Powers' tab; Gear & Assets, vehicles, and voidships will be on the 'Equipment' tab; objectives, background, malignancies, and alliances are on the 'Personal' tab.
12. Moved ascension notes to the Abilities tab as an expanded note by Tier.
13. Added section for entering psychic powers.
14. Added a section for listing multiple vehicles and voidships under Equipment for PC/Adversary view.
15. Added section in Powers for Psychic powers with the ability to roll a test, push the test, and roll damage.
16. Added a new column to skills with an assist roll; assist rolls do not include wrath dice.
17. Created a view for vehicles and voidships; these views include fields for entering a pool of dice for rolls. Players can also make the appropriate tests from their character sheet.

Note:  No existing attributes were changed or removed.  Existing functionality was expanded.

Fixes:
    1. Toggling of Use Inline Dice vs API.  When checked and then unchecked, every time the sheet would be reopened it was defaulting to checked.  It should open to the value it closed on... checked or unchecked.

** July 26th, 2018: version 1.0 submitted to Roll20** 
- resubmitted on August 6th due to roll20 packaging error.

### Known Issues
1. Inline rolls do not show two successes on a 6 and die modifier is not added; this functionality is not core within the Roll20 capabilities and an expanded formula needs to be created.
