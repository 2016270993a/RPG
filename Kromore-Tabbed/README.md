This character sheet is designed for the Kromore game system.  

Based on the character sheet created by Doug Hamerski, this sheet for the Kromore system includes a massive increase in terms of features. Tabs are present for storing character creation information, profession and growth information, equipment, and for skills. The skill page includes listings for every skill in the book and a comprehensive system for adding up inherent bonuses to skills and combat so that the player does not have to add them up in his or her head. The equipment tab includes sections for every type of equippable gear (as well as consumables) and handy equip buttons that will automatically transfer stats from equipment to the skills page so that you don't have to recalculate your attack dice whenever you change weapons!
