### Impact on existing sheets
- It is recomended to "reselect" the "Test Target" on the "Intrusion Countermeasuers" tab of the Matrix sheet
- Add Dermal Armor to the "Mods" column for "Body"
- If using an "Offhand" melee weapon, create a new "Weapon" with both the Primary and OffHand weapon.  Use the +Dice and +TN fields to add the appropriate extra dice ( 1/2 offhand skill ) and penalty ( depends on ambidexterity edge )
