# Maschinenleben Character Sheet (SWADE)
This character sheet was originally made for **Maschinenleben** (released later this year), a fan product for the **Savage Worlds Adventure Edition** (SWADE) about cyborgs struggling with their loss of self. Due to its extensive build and customization options, it may be used for many other settings as well.

## Notable Features

## Change Log

## Development
The character sheet is compiled from [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) templates with [SCSS/SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) (LibSass). You need both in order to contribute; do not directly modify the compiled HTML and CSS files because these changes will be overwritten and vanish!

### Contribution Guidelines
* Make sure to always delete `@charset "UTF-8";` from the compiled CSS! Roll20 will not load it otherwise.
* Follow the 8Ã—8 pixel grid (starting top-left) and use padding if necessary. It must not be broken!
* The devil is in the detail. Align and size all elements as precise as possible, down to one pixel!
* Use [Block Element Modifiers](http://getbem.com/naming/) to name CSS classes.

### Legal
The silhouette images were made from purchased assets and are only licensed for this sheet. Do not take them for any other purposes! This does not go for the human silhouettes which were made with the [HeroMachine 3](http://www.heromachine.com/heromachine-3-lab/) and are therefore free.
