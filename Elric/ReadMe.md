# Elric! / Stormbringer Character Sheet as this it usses a  different system to Stormbringer 1st - 4th edition.  It may also be suitable for MAgic World if you ignore the graphics.

One thing to note is the way the damage works.  Instead of just knocking  points down as damage is taken there is a damage box so you can put in wounds as they are taken so that you can apply first aid separately.  So if you take a 2pt wound and then a 4 point wound the damage box  should look like 2+4. Make sure there is no trailing + signs, so don't have it look like 3+5+ .
