I originally began to improve this sheet from the original which was broken,
In order to play 2E with friends. Some of the designs have been from there requests.

The Condition Monitor and Dice Pools are always present no matter what tab you are on.

Character/Lifestyle Tab -- Attributes and Lifestyle Info and Karma.

SKills/Edges/Flaws-- These have been grouped together to make it easier to apply any
		     modifiers related to them when rolling.

Magic/Spells -- Tab includes Spells/Notes Physical Adepts and a section for Shamans.

Combat -- Weapons info has been moved to Combat.  This makes it easier to figure out 
	  damage and resisting without having to move tabs during combat. 
	  All combat related mods are here, and a section included for recording
	  weapon skill ratings so no tab change needed when the Ranged and Melee rolls
	  ask for weapon skill rating. 

PLEASE NOTE: This contains code from the original/improved sheet as well as code added 
             by myself and other sheet authors.
