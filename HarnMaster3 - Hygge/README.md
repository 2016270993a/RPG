Harn Master Character Sheet
===========================

This sheet is for use with the [Harn Master](http://columbiagames.com/cgi-bin/query/cfg/zoom.cfg?product_id=4001) roleplaying game version 3, by [Columbia Games](http://columbiagames.com/).

Use of the sheet is pretty straight forward.  The sheet includes a number of features and helper scripts including:

Auto-Calculations:
* Armor Load
* Weapon Load
* Inventory Load
* Encubrance
* Endurance
* Injury Totals
* Physical Penalty
* Universal Penalty

Features:
* Roll buttons for each skill that includes appropriate physical/universal penalty.
* Shock/Fumble/Stumble checks.
* Healing Rolls
* Weapon Quality Checks
* Attack/Defense rolls with adjustments.
* Spell/Ritual/Psionic checks.
* EMLs for in sheet rolls are capped at 5/95 respectively as per rules.
* Checkbox under load toggles correct Fatigue and Encumberance for Mounted players.

NOTE
====

This is **NOT** a character generator.  Due to limits in logic it does not calculate SBs and does not auto-add armor protection values (though it does add armor load).

HOUSE RULES
===========

This sheet based of the main HarnMaster3 sheet from roll20 (https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets) has been adapted to some of our house rules:

* The Condition skill can be used to calculate encumbrance penalties, instead of using Endurance.
