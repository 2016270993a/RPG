Harn Master Character Sheet
===========================

This sheet is for use with the [Harn Master](http://columbiagames.com/cgi-bin/query/cfg/zoom.cfg?product_id=4001) roleplaying game version 3, by [Columbia Games](http://columbiagames.com/).

Use of the sheet is pretty straight forward.  The sheet includes a number of features and helper scripts including:


Features:
* 3 Tabs for Character, Inventory and Settings
* Roll buttons for each skill that includes appropriate physical/universal penalty.
* Development roll buttons for each skill
* Shock/Fumble/Stumble checks.
* Healing Rolls
* Weapon Quality Checks
* Attack/Defense rolls with adjustments.
* Dedicated roll button to roll attacks with HM penalty
* Spell/Ritual/Psionic checks.
* EMLs for in sheet rolls are capped at 5/95 respectively as per rules.
* Checkbox under load toggles correct Fatigue and Encumberance for Mounted players. It also updates initiative and movement for the character based on horse information from the Horse section (if enabled)
* An included horse section to facilitate HarnMaster horse combat rules where character and horse skills are averaged. (this section can be shown/hidden via the Settings tab)
* Items on the Inventory tab can be marked as "Carried", which affects the Character tab: weight will be added to load carried, armor values will be added to armor protection and weapons will show up on the Character tab to roll attack, defense and WQ checks.


Auto-Calculations:
* Armor Load
* Weapon Load
* Inventory Load
* Encubrance
* Endurance
* Injury Totals
* Physical Penalty
* Universal Penalty
* Armor values: add armour pieces (find values in the HM3 Rulebook) in the inventory tab, fill in armor values for B/E/P/F and check locations covered. Check them as "worn/carried (C)" and total armor values are shown on the character tab.
* Easily drop weapons and reduce inventory load (and encumbrance) on the fly
* Auto calculate initiave and effective horse riding skill automatically for the horse included in the horse section, when "Mounted" (checkbox)

NOTE
====

This is **NOT** a character generator.  Due to limits in logic it does not calculate SBs and does not auto-add armor protection values (though it does add armor load).
