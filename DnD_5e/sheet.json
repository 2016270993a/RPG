	"instructions": "This sheet is designed for use with the full release of DnD 5th edition.  Where possible, it supports the 'rules as written' as listed in the Basic DnD PDF that's freely available for download.  Prior to the release of the Players HandBook (PHB), currently scheduled for August 2014, support for classes outside of the 4 provided by basic DnD should be considered incomplete and a preview only.  The sheet will be updated as required shortly after the PHB becomes available and the intention is that it will be maintained beyond this too.  Note: This sheet is NOT compatible with the playtest ruleset (DnD Next) and if you are still using the Next rules you should use the older, and no longer maintained, DnD Next sheet instead.  It's also advisable to avoid trying to transfer existing characters between this and the older 'Next' sheet as they are not fully compatible."
