    "instructions": "# You can click on an Attribute name to roll against your attributes.\r\For attacks, you can enter powers or weapons. You need the Name, the Attribute to roll against (e.g. Resolute for most Powers), the normal damage, its Quality (does not affect rolls), and bonuses (ie raw damage, bonus roll, bonus to attack). Bonus dmg will not roll, but will just show extra damage. For example, you could have Robust give you a 1d4 extra damage as its own attack and use it after a successful attack. \r\rArmor is similar in that Quality will not affect rolls, and Bonus def will allow for extra negation. Change the Impede section to reflect armor impeding"
