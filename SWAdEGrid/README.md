## Changelog
2020-04-22 Version 1.0
* Initial build.  Panes resize & reflow as character sheet window grows & shrinks.  Modifiers tracked on separate page.

## Known Issues
* Modifiers can't be cleared or reset easily
* Edges, Hindrances, Abilities, and other custom rules are textareas only and do not calculate into dice rolls
    *  Modifiers can be updated to calculate those on a per-roll basis
* Custom buttons don't work well on tablet (at least on an iPad)
