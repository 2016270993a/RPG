    "instructions": "This sheet is for John Harper's Agon Role Playing Game (Agon-rpg.com).  Recent updates inlude resizing many page elements, fixing some elements, and shifting column contents around to improve usablilty. Also added a number of features: \n* Added NPC and Minion sheets (click \"PC NAME\" for dropdown). \n* An Agon Die Roller at top right: just enter a dice string (like \"1d8+1d6+2\") and click the title to roll. \n* A combat die roller - enter the dice in the Left Hand and Right hand boxes (e.g. 1d6+1d8+1d10) and click the title to roll them. \n* The title of each Ability is a button to roll that Ability. This button automatically rolls the Ability, the Name Die, and asks for any other dice (enter a valid die string like 1d6+2 or 1d10+2d6).\n* Wound Penalties are included in Ability and Combat rolls. Temporary wound modifiers (Wounds 1-3) are applied; after making a roll, uncheck the \"Clear Temporary Penalties\" box to remove them."
