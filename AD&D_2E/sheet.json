    "instructions": "This sheet, while not identical to the original AD&D 2E sheet from TSR, should contain everything you need to run a character or monster in an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Second Edition game. The sheet contains auto-calculating values for several math-heavy sections, and buttons for commonly used rolls. Additionally, the sheet now supports most features from the Players Option books."
