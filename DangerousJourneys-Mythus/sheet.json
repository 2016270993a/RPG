The first checkbox next to each K/S is whether your HP possesess the K/S Area, and the second checkbox is whether the K/S area generates Heka.  You can keep the Heka generation checkboxes at their default settings, but some (Ecology/Nature Science for Wisemen/Wisewomen) vary by Vocation or by GM fiat, so the options exist. \n  Ignore ShadowAttrs, as they are a debug tool which will enentually not be visible.\n  For now you can type all armor, weapons, Castings, and Powers in manually or use the import buttons; an Excel 2016 sheet is found in the repository at xxxx.  Note that this Excel workbook is not a generator and does not pretend to be, but is instead a reference for the import syntax in case someone wishes to develop one outside Roll20. \n  The K/S area for Foreign Language is initially invisible but a button exists on the K/S tab which allows you to add multiple Foreign Languages as needed.\n  There is an alternative view on most of the same stats called the Bestiary view, accessible at the bottom of the Config page.  It is meant for non-player personas and monsters and is still a work in progress."
