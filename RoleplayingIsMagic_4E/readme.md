# Roleplaying is Magic: Season 4 edition character sheet

This character sheet is for [Roleplaying is Magic: Season 4 edition](http://roleplayingismagic.com/),
a popular fan-created tabletop RPG system based upon the world of
My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and developed by Roan Arts.

## RiM Dice script

The skill rolling buttons in this sheet make use of an API script for rolling
dice and skill checks specifically for the Roleplaying is Magic system. This
script is published with the sheet as the file ```mlp_dice.js```. If you use
this sheet, it is highly recommended that you also install this API script for
your campaign.

For the skill rolling buttons to work, you must also be speaking as the
character you are rolling the skill for.

The script can also be used as a
chat command. This is documented in the ```mlp_dice.js``` script.
