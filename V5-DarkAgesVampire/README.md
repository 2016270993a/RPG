# Character sheet for Vampire The Dark Ages, 5th Edition (v1.0)
# Based on Character sheet for Vampire The Maquerade, 5th Edition (v2.4)


## Known Bugs

When running with the API script, errors may occur if the player enters a name with tilde (\~), this is because the tilde is symbol I've used to identify names. There are no plans to fix this as this was introduce to enable full names.

## Skill Name Changes

The names of four skills have changed, however the intent is that the area covered by these skills remains roughly the same. Drive becomes Ride (For Horses and carriages etc), Firearms becomes Aim (whilst normally Athletics covers archery, the intention here is to use what was firearms to separate out the skill), Science becomes Alchemy (Not related to Thin Blood Alchemy, but is to reflect the potential view of science to people of that time) and Technology becomes Engineering (The term changes to closer reflect the type of technology of the time).

## User Guide and Installation Instructions (Please read)

This Sheet is based on the Character sheet for Vampire The Maquerade, 5th Edition, as such all notes for that are applicable here. While this sheet is designed to be as intuitive as possible and to aid in stream lining your game there are several key features which are worth being aware of. As such we highly recommend you read the [VtM 5th Edition Sheet Guide](https://wiki.roll20.net/Vampire_The_Masquerade_5th_edition#Welcome_to_The_World_of_Darkness). The [VtM 5th Edition Sheet Guide](https://wiki.roll20.net/Vampire_The_Masquerade_5th_edition#Welcome_to_The_World_of_Darkness) also contains installation instructions and details about the API script.
