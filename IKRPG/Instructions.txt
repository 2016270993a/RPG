The Steamjack tab and NPC tabs are meant to be used alone, and not anything controlled by the player.  

In particular, the DEF and ARM stat is a combinatin of the main character, the Steamjack sheet, and the NPC sheet.  
When using the targeted rolls, the sheet will use the total DEF and ARM of the character sheet. 
To prevent this, use a seperate journal for each PC, NPC, and 'jack.

Most buttons include the option to add dice.  However, the option to "add a die, dropping the lowest" hasn't be added, except for the Virtuoso button on the weapons.

The clickable button in the center of the basic tab is for tracking feats.
