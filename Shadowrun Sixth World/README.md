Shadowrun Sixth World Character Sheet

**`This is a work in progress.`**

At this point only the PC sheet is functional and that is lacking all work in the Matrix section.

TO DO
=
**`PC Sheet`** - 
	* Entire Matrix tab
	* Add Mod inputs to the repeating skills to allow for temporary mods to skill based rolls.
	* Add Armor Social Ratings from Firing Squad pg50

**`Grunt Sheet`**
	* everything

**`Host Sheet`**
	* everything

**`Sprite Sheet`**
	* everything

**`Vehicle Sheet`**
	* everything


**`Future Features Wishlist`**
	* Extended Tests Roller?
	* Make current "Modifiers" text parsed and used to apply modifiers directly to sheet attributes.  For example having "Reaction: +1" in the Modifiers box would automatically apply +1 to the reaction attribute, thus affecting all rolls relying on that attribute.  An advanced idea for this is to have checkboxes to indicate if these modifiers are active currently or not.  I can see these being useful in Adept Powers, Augments, Equipment and possibly other areas.
	* Add Autosofts to Vehicles tab
	* Make Magic updated if Essence drops below it
	* Add Magic AR to Metamagic Tab
	* Armor Social Ratings (Firing Squad p50)
	* Have Firing Mode automatically change how many rounds are used when firing.
	* Add Mod inputs to the repeating skills to allow for temporary mods to skill based rolls.
