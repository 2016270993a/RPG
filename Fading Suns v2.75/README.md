# TODO list

- Added characteric, skill & roll buttons for Combat actions (weapons)

- Increase match with sections of the official character sheet for Weapons, Armor, Shield, Combat actions, Weapons (melee + ranged)

- Add ability to manually link a Combat action / Weapon entry to its corresponding Combat skill (e.g. Fists => Fight, Imman Vorton .40 => Slug Guns, etc..) and 3 different roll buttons for Dex, Str (tbc) and Per (for long range)

- [TBC] use short names for characteristics in weapon/psi/theurgy tables

- migrate wyrd/vita radio button layout to https://wiki.roll20.net/CSS_Wizardry#Fill_Radio_Buttons_to_the_Left
  preventing the selection to go higher than the max as well

- after the next pull request, replace the snazzy d10 image from the Ambition_Avarice sheet with own, to avoid dependency to another sheet

- ability for users to report a bug found in the sheet

- Ensure a 1 is always a success, even when the goal number is < 0 due to a high malus

- Improve instructions in sheet.json with markdown
  add contact info

- Ability to switch b/w public vs GM roll

- update selected_skill_value when a non-repeating skill value changes (done already for repeating creative/lore skills)

- add a section for Body Modifications (incl. Cyberware)

- add a section for Movement (default: 5)

- add a section for Languages

- Initiative roll query - translations from English

- Vitality critical levels (-2 to -10) to affect goal numbers

- Weapons & armors property checkboxes (Shock, Laser, Plasma, etc..) & replace d6rolls with proper damage/armor rolls showing shield-piercing vs normal damage, etc.

- Support for Symbiot characters

# Nice-to-have
- Infoboxes, e.g. how to compute init, wyrd, vita...

- xp changes lead to traits updates (characs + skills + derived ones like vita, wyrd, init)

- Fading Suns Logo

- Sheet for spaceships
