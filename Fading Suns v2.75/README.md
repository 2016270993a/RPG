# TODO
- /!\ Remove dependency on API

- Allow choice b/w public vs GM roll
- Initiative roll query - English translation
- Initiative roll query - parse list of Combat Styles known by the character
- Vitality critical levels (-2 to -10) to affect roll goals
- Combo-boxes for Characteristic & Skills => auto-determination of goal rolls for Combat actions, Psi powers, Theurgy rituals, etc..
- Weapons & armors property checkboxes (Shock, Laser, Plasma, etc..) & replace d6rolls with proper damage/armor rolls showing shield-piercing vs normal damage, etc.
- Support for Symbiot characters
- Body Modifications (= Cyber) section

# Nice-to-have
- Description of labels, computation info (e.g. init, wyrd, vita)
- Fading Suns Logo?
