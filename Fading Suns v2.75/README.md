# TODO list

- General improvements to goal rolls
  - Ability to switch b/w public vs GM roll
  - Vitality critical levels (-2 to -10) to affect goal numbers
  - Ensure a 1 is always a success, even when the goal number is < 0 due to a high malus

- Add ability to manually link a Combat action / Weapon entry to its corresponding Combat skill (e.g. Fists => Fight, Imman Vorton .40 => Slug Guns, etc..) and 3 different roll buttons for Dex, Str (tbc) and Per (for long range)

- Increase similarity to the official character sheet when it comes to naming sections: Armor, Shield, Combat actions, Weapons (melee + ranged)
  - add a section for Body Modifications (incl. Cyberware)
  - add a section for Movement (default: 5)
  - add a section for Languages

- [TBC] use short names for characteristics in weapon/psi/theurgy tables to save up on space

- after the next pull request, replace the snazzy d10 image from the Ambition_Avarice sheet with own, to avoid dependency to another sheet

- ability for users to report a bug found in the sheet

- Initiative roll query - translations from English

- Weapons & armors property checkboxes (Shock, Laser, Plasma, etc..) & replace d6rolls with proper damage/armor rolls showing shield-piercing vs normal damage, etc.

- Support for Symbiot characters

# Nice-to-have
- Infoboxes, e.g. how to compute init, wyrd, vita...

- xp changes lead to traits updates or vice versa (characs, skills, derived ones like vita, wyrd, init)

- Fading Suns Logo

- Sheet for spaceships
