When you use the roll button you will see, in the chat log, a roll \"vs standard value/hard value/extreme value.\"  Compare the appropriate threshold to your result to determine success.  For weapon skill select one of the listed skills to base your weapon skill check on.  You may select up to the tenth custom skill as the base skill.  For weapon damages you may specify a \"+0\", \"+1/2db\" or \"+db.\"  Use this to include your damage bonus in the damage roll or not.\n\n In support of Pulp Cthulhu a checkbox in the Hit Points section allows for the Pulp Cthulhu rules variant of doubling hit points. \n\n Aqua Alex: (1)removed the need for the js file and created a Workerscript to enable autocalculation of Damage Bonus and Build even for people without a Pro account.\n (2) removed my roll button and put old roll button back but left my smaller rolltemplate for future changes\n (5) added calculation of move\n (6) BONUS/PENALTY Dice rolls - Grey Button is for current Roll template, Green button is for the smaller (1 roll) roll template, this will be implemented in future."
