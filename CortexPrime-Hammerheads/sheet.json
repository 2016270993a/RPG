I refer to this as the suggested best result.\n\n##Stress and Trauma\n\nI have been using API macro's to adjust Stress values. But these are simply Attributes (PhysicalStress, MentalStress, SocialStress and PhysicalTrauma, MentalTrauma, SocialTrauma ).\nYou can add these to the Attributes and Abilities tab manually, and assign values ranging from the 4,6,8,10 or 12 corresponding to the dice value.\n\nIf you have added a stress and it's not showing check the spelling, Capitalisation, and dice value to be sure you got those all correct.\n\nAny feedback, or requests - I'm happy to hear.\n\n---\n\nHammerheads is a part of the Cortex Prime Game Handbook published by Fandom Inc, and was written, designed, and developed by Cam Banks.\nHammerheads uses the Cortex system.
