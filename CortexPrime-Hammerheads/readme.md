Cortex Prime: Hammerhead Character Sheet

##Set up

- Select One of the Portraits, or select the dot next to the word Portrait to set no portrait.

##Dice Pool Builder

The inbuilt Dice Pool Builder pulls from the character's attributes, rolls and keeps highest two dice in the pool by default. I refer to this as the suggested best result.

##Stress and Trauma

I have been using API macro's to adjust Stress values. But these are simply Attributes (PhysicalStress, MentalStress, SocialStress and PhysicalTrauma, MentalTrauma, SocialTrauma ).
You can add these to the Attributes and Abilities tab manually, and assign values ranging from the 4,6,8,10 or 12 corresponding to the dice value.

If you have added a stress and it's not showing check the spelling, Capitalisation, and dice value to be sure you got those all correct.

Any feedback, or requests - I'm happy to hear.
