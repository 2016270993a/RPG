Star Wars Saga Edition Character Sheet
=======================
Welcome to my rendition of the Star Wars Saga Edition Character sheet. 
My goal is to make this all encompassing for the current and any House Rules which may come up.

As this is a work in progress, please excuse the fact this is not completed.

I've used this sheet (http://www.mad-irishman.net/pub_starwars.html) as a reference for the design. Because of how things are formatted with CSS I've excluded some fields to make things "prettier" and well, because I don't find them necessary.

In this folder there's also some API code which can be used in conjunction with the character sheet to create all the Attributes in a pretty, orderly manner, as well as creating Abilities for the Skills. When used, the API will take affect after the Character entry has been created and saved for the first time.

TO DO
============
* ~~List out all Skills with modifiers and rolls~~
* ~~Use repeating function to include weapons and attacks having the user choose which Ability Mod and damage for pre-filled rolls~~
* Fix Attack Repeating function (overall this won't be working the way I want till a repeating roll function is included)
* Make it prettier with CSS (~~incorporate logos~~, etc)

Suggestions
============
Please send me a message if you have any suggestions.
