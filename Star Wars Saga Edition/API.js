/* Automatically create the character sheet when a new character journal is added.
* Default min / max of attributes may be adjusted below.
* Updated 4/10/2014 to pre-fill the Journal with the attributes used in the Character Sheet for better organization.
* Updated 3/30/2014 including arrays and for the most part cleaning up the code in the process. Now to add attributes and
* abilities just include them in the order in which the should appear on the sheet.
*
*
* Thanks to Jarod for assisting in getting the arrays to work.
