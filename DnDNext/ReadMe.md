The lay out is mostly done with tables, though everything has a class so it's enough to rework what you want with the CSS.

Aaron Moore was awesome made all the formula's work for autocalculating skills, avility score modifiers and proficiency bonus.

The lay out has been reworked so it looks consistent in design with character sheets by others within the community.

There is a little tweaking left to do with certain field sizes to make the format work happy with firefox. This update will be made after the most recent pull request goes through. I will need to wait on Riley's final word to see if the sheet is even added to the drop down menu. Once that is said and done, I'll do a few edits to make firefox happy and document the changes.

Have fun!
