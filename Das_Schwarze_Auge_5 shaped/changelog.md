## Versioning
I use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) which has 3 numbers separated by a dot: Major.Minor.Patch

I use Major versions a bit liberally - I consider the following to be major changes:
* Any changes to existing roll template fields
* Any change to a repeating section which makes existing macro references break

New features are a minor version.

Bugs fall into the patch category.


## 1.0.0

### Features
