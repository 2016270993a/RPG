The second box next to the physical attributes is for Armour stats, and the second roll button uses those instead of the normal ones, as well as applying the meikyo bonus automatically. The roll buttons next to the physical stats roll that armour stat with the Interface skill, for armour riders. Wound bonuses are added automatically as well (only based on the character's wounds, not the armour's.)"
