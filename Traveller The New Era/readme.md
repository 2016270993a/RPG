#Traveller: The New Era

Based on the Twillight 2000 v2.2 sheet.

Uses repeating sections for skills, contacts and weapons.

Some rolling functionality for skills and weapons and Rolltables from the Twillight 2000 sheet.

Currently sheetworkers are not working.

Minimal layout at the moment.

Proably quite a bit of redundant CSS and probalby a bit of redundant html as well.

Skills from Twillight 2000, Dark Conspiracy, and Caddilacs & Dinasours could be added.
