When your character is damaged, tick off the appropriate number of radio buttons. If you enter a new category of damage (such as Light), Tick the checkbox under the name. The exception to this is when you are seriously injured. There are two radio buttons that will apply -2 to your Ref. Tick the one on the right to apply the -2. When you are no longer seriously wounded (Not Wounded, Light, Critical or Mortal), make sure to undo the -2 by clicking the radio button on the left."
