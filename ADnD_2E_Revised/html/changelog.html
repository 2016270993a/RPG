            <ul style="font-style:italic">
                <li>Completely redesigned the new spell section, so each spell can be on a single line, showing Name, Range, and Area of Effect
                    <ul>
                        <li>Single line spells can be folded out to show additional information of the spells</li>
                        <li>Removed the "Roll Spell Effect" button as it caused more confusion than it helped</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Added Spell tracking selection to the Sheet Settings Tab. Choices are: Spell Slots, Spell Points, Arcs / Winds</li>
                <li>Redesigned the Spells tab to only show the spell tracking system that selected on the Sheet Settings Tab</li>
                <li>High Wisdom now triggers a popup asking if you are a priest. Bonus spells are only added if you are a priest</li>
                <li>High Wisdom now autofill bonus Winds for Priests for the Arcs/Winds spell tracking system, based on the same popup as stated above. If the PO: S&P sub ability scores are used, base Wisdom is still used for determining bonus winds</li>
                <li>Added support for automatic Spell Points for Wizards with high Intelligence. This is a toggle as the bonus is optional.</li>
                <li>Added support for automatic Spell Points for Priests with high Wisdom. This is a toggle as only priests gets this bonus, and not Paladins and Rangers. The Priest caster level is used to determine how many spell points should be given</li>
                <li>Fixed bonus spells from high Intuition from PO: Skills & Powers. Willpower was incorrectly used</li>
                <li>Regeneration from high Constitution now clarifies that it is per turn(s)</li>
                <li>Only show up and down arrows on numeric input fields in Firefox on hover or focus</li>
                <li>Styled Monster tab to have dynamically sized fields, and larger fields for Hit Dice, HP, and Max HP</li>
                <li>Updated saving throws to tell how much the check was made or missed by</li>
                <li>2Espell - Sensory signature and Knockdown switched places to make them appear in the same order as in the PO: Spells & Magic book</li>
            </ul>
