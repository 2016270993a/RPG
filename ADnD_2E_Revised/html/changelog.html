            <ul style="font-style:italic">
                <li>Added better description for Open Door checks</li>
                <li>Added missing misc modifier for Open Door checks</li>
                <li>Added Misc Modifier to the three static monster attack buttons</li>
                <li>Added notes for Head and Touch AC</li>
                <li>Added notes for Touch-delivered spells</li>
                <li>Added notes for wishing for ability scores</li>
                <li>Added reverse spells. All data related to the reverse spell is exactly the same as the original spell. I.e. no special changes have been made specific to the reverse spell.</li>
                <li>Added inline labels for modifiers to attack, damage, initiative, surprise, saving throw, and magic resistance rolls</li>
                <li>Corrected color for initiative rolls. Now a roll of 1 will have a green boarder (crit) and a roll of 10 will have a red boarder (fumble)</li>
                <li>Improved the layout for Player's Option critical hits a bit</li>
                <li>Fixed cast time for <strong>Protection From Evil (Wizard)</strong> from 1 turn to +1 initiative modifier</li>
                <li>Removed incorrect material components for <strong>Endure Cold/Endure Heat</strong></li>
                <li>Fixed spell description layout for <strong>Orison</strong></li>
                <li>Removed Weapon Type vs Armor type modifiers from the Hit roll under the Player's Option ruleset, as the Player's Option: Combat & Tactics has its own set of modifiers that differ from those given in the Player's Handbook</li>
                <li>Weapon Type vs Armor type is now only visible under the <strong>Standard</strong> tab</li>
                <li>Change scroll naming convention from "Scroll of X" to "X scroll". This put the spell name first and makes it easier to read on small screens.</li>
                <li>Fixed Follower->Psion->Repeating->Standard->Initiative button</li>
            </ul>
