	"instructions": "# Mage: The Ascension Character Sheet\r For use in the classic World of Darkness, 20th Anniversary Edition.  Designed to function much like an actual paper sheet would.  With the most notable exception being that you can roll dice from the sheet.  There is button at the top of the sheet which will prompt for the size of the dice pool for generic rolls.  Arete and Willpower can also be rolled directy from the sheet.  The Dice Pool section in the center at the bottom allow one to select an Attribute and/or Ability to roll; The Other Traits may also be selected in the Ability pulldown.  All rolls from the sheet are of the form [[{Xd10s}>Df1]], where X is the number of dice and D is the difficulty.  The rolls will prompt the user to give an action and set the difficulty (default 6).  The pick boxes in the Health area will modify the number of dice for the Willpower and Dice Pool buttons.  NOTE: These rolls do not recognize botches nor specialties, so these will have to be handled the old fashion way.  The Quintessesnce wheel has a pulldown menu with two different symbols so one can distinguish between a point of Quintessence and a point of Paradox.  The "Ψ" is Quintessence and the "✖" is paradox.  The Health area has pickboxes, to set the diepool penalty for the current health level, and pulldowns to set the damage type for each health level.  The "/" for bashing, the "X" for lethal, and the "Ж" for aggravated.  The text box to the right of the dots is intended for specialties or foci, it works well for onther notes too."
