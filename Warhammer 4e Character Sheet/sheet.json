	"instructions": "**This is a Character Sheet for Warhammer Fantasy 4e inspired by the classic 2e version** TokenMod API is used for Condition Marker setting/unsetting, this requires custom WFRP4e Token Marker Set, download @ https://github.com/Djjus/Vault/blob/master/Warhammer%204e%20Character%20Sheet/markers/WFRP4eset1.0.zip which i recomend for roll20 games if your going to use the API or not. 

I strongly suggest you read the Readme file @ https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/Warhammer%204e%20Character%20Sheet/README.md

Enjoy."
