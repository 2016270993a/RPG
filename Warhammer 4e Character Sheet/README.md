# Warhammer 4e Character Sheet (Djjus)

This is a fork of https://github.com/vicberg/Roll20-Warhammer-4e-Character-Sheet, which itself is a port of a original WHFRP2e Template.

This Character Sheet has been updated to fix and enhance mostly in the original style. And uploaded to Roll20 for all to use.

Changes include:

- Reworked Initiative Roll button, with 3 Core book rule options. See Settings cog.
- Moved Wounds/Advantage/Fate points out of the tabs to the top of the sheet for better access.
- Rework on the Skills tab, Mostly for Skills which require working Attrbutes for macros.
- Background Tab moved
- Rework of Weapons (formerly Combat) Tab. With Skill selector for Melee/Ranged specilizations.
- Rework of Spellbook Tab. Removed unused 2e spell sub tabs. Spells now work correctly and added Channelling Test button for Arcane spells.


Usage Notes:

- Wounds: ensure correct Race and HArdy level are chose. Wounds are subtracted by adding damage, and given back by subtracting it.
- Advantage Field applied to Attacks and Combat Action Skills automatically.
- For an advanced talent you must select the taken checkbox in order to roll.
- On Weapons ensure you select the coresponding skill (Melee Basic, Melee Parrying or Ranged Bow or Ranged Blackpowder or other Melee or Ranged Skills)
- Spells need to have a number in CN and Damage Field or they will not roll correctly, both fields will default to Zero.


Possible additons to come :

- Experiance spending log which interacts with XP Earned/Spent/Remaining



Enjoy.
