 Darklands Character Sheet

This is an attempt to create a Roll20 character sheet for a demo update of the out-of-print 90s RPG Darklands. It uses an interesting d10 system and was developed by Eric Mau.

The original Darklands game is public domain, and any work contained here is free to use, as long as Eric Mau and me (Zach Wheat) are credited.

It's ugly as sin, but functional. 


Most of the CSS didn't do much so IO removed the DIV tags and it's looking very 90s flat html for now.
